<p>Microsoft has scrubbed all mention of Holiday 2020 from the Surface Neo&#8217;s website.</p>



<p>If you were looking forward to getting your hands on Microsoft&#8217;s Surface Neo dual-screen, Windows 10X-powered tablet before the end of the year, we&#8217;ve got some bad news. Microsoft has scrubbed all mention of the Neo&#8217;s holiday 2020 launch from its website.</p>



<p>This comes after several months of rumors and sideways hints of the tablet&#8217;s delay. Last we heard, Panos Panay, Microsoft&#8217;s Chief Product Officer for Windows and devices, said in May that the company &#8220;will continue to look for the right moment, in conjunction with our OEM partners, to bring dual-screen devices to market.&#8221; That seemed to indicate that the Neo&#8217;s ETA was in flux, but the messaging on the website (or lack thereof) cements it.</p>



<p>The discovery was made by Neowin and arrives to us via TechRadar. Text on the Surface Neo&#8217;s page, which used to end with the phrase &#8220;Coming Holiday 2020,&#8221; now suggests nothing about when interested consumers can expect the device. There is still a form at the bottom where visitors can register their interest for updates, but that&#8217;s it.</p>



<p>Now, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/microsoft-surface-duo">Surface Duo</a> — Microsoft&#8217;s dual-screen phone powered by Android — is still on track to ship before the end of the year. In fact, given that the phone is appearing in cryptic official videos and has just passed Bluetooth certification, it seems we could be mere weeks away from the Duo&#8217;s release.</p>



<p>Microsoft will want to get the Surface Duo out the door as quickly as possible to head off the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2, which will likely be announced during Samsung&#8217;s August 5 Unpacked event.</p>



<p>Of course, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 will incorporate a single flexible folding display as opposed to the traditional butterfly design of the Surface Duo. It&#8217;s going to be a dated look by comparison, but hopefully Microsoft will be able to use that to its advantage, and make the Duo cheaper than its competition.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Windows 10X will arrive on single-screen devices, like regular Surface tablets and notebooks first, sometime in 2021. There&#8217;s no word on how far off the Surface Neo is at this time; a recent report from ZDNet suggested the Neo might not reappear until spring 2022, which would be a crippling blow to Microsoft&#8217;s dual-screen ambitions. We certainly hope that&#8217;s not the case. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Catalan independence leader was part of 1,400 spyware attacks worldwide</p>



<p>A leading Spanish politician who has campaigned for Catalan independence had his phone targeted by spyware in an incident seen as “domestic espionage”,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/28/whatsapp-confirms-catalan-politicians-phone-was-target-of-2019-attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Guardian</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Messaging app <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/528-whatsapp-how-to-user-guide.html">WhatsApp</a> has written to Roger Torrent, the president of the Catalan regional parliament, to confirm he was the target of a cyberattack that took place via the platform in mid-2019.</p>



<h2 id="apparent-act-of-espionage-xa0">Apparent act of espionage&nbsp;</h2>



<p>WhatsApp&#8217;s letter, which has been viewed by journalists at the Guardian and El Pais, claims that the attackers targeted Torrent in order to “gain unauthorized access to data and communications on the device”.</p>



<p>Niamh Sweeney, director of public policy for Europe, the Middle East and Asia at WhatsApp, explained in the letter that attackers, possibly working at the behest of the Spanish national government, used the messaging platform to spy on Torrent’s phone without him knowing. </p>



<p>She wrote: “By ‘targeted’ we are referring to the fact that the attackers attempted to inject malicious code into Mr Torrent’s WhatsApp application.</p>



<p>“Based on the information available to us, we are not in a position to confirm whether Mr Torrent’s device was compromised as this could only be achieved through an exhaustive forensic analysis of the device.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="a-wider-attack">A wider attack</h2>



<p>Sweeney explained that the Catalan nationalist politician was among 1,400 WhatsApp users across the world targeted by spyware in 2019, including government officials, diplomatic professionals, reporters, and human rights campaigners in many countries. </p>



<p>In all cases, the various perpetrators are believed to have used spyware manufactured and sold to governments by Israeli cybersecurity firm NSO Group. The firm hasn’t issued a comment on the incident, according to the Guardian.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The WhatsApp flaw exploited by the NSO Group spyware was patched on May 13, 2019.</p>



<p>Two other members of the Catalan independence movement were targeted in the WhatsApp espionage,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/13/phone-of-top-catalan-politician-targeted-by-government-grade-spyware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Guardian</a>&nbsp;said in an earlier story. The newspaper said these are the first known instances of NSO Group spyware being used in Europe.</p>



<p>“We advocate for strong legal oversight of cyber weapons like the ones used in this cyberattack to ensure they are not used to violate individual rights and the freedoms people deserve, wherever they are in the world,” said Sweeney in her letter to Torrent.</p>



<p>The Guardian said Torrent is preparing to sue Félix Sanz Roldán, the former boss of the Spanish National Intelligence Center. He led the agency when the attacks took place last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WhatsApp has sued NSO Group in U.S. federal court for violating the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The case is still proceeding.</p>



<h2 id="such-attacks-are-growing">Such attacks are growing</h2>



<p>Christoph Hebeisen, director of security intelligence at Lookout, warned that these types of attacks are becoming more common across the world.</p>



<p>He said: “The use of sophisticated mobile surveillanceware for domestic spying purposes appears more widespread than previously known, including in western democracies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“In light of widespread election meddling and spying on political parties and movements all over the world it is clear that protecting information and communication infrastructure including mobile devices is quickly becoming critical to any organization with a need for confidentiality.”</p>

<p>The Pixel 4a should be available August 3, but it could get lost in the Samsung hype</p>



<p>After months of speculation and shifting timetables, the Google Pixel 4a is finally coming. Yes, there’s an actual release date for this (once) highly anticipated Android phone, and it happens to be just two days away from the launch date for the Samsung Galaxy Note 20. </p>



<p>According to leaker Jon Prosser, the Pixel 4a’s release date is August 3. He says that he is “100%” certain via <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1287498664743702529">Twitter</a>. But will Google be able to make much noise given the tech world will be focused on Samsung&#8217;s big news? The specs and price will answer that question.</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t been following the Pixel 4a rumors, it&#8217;s expected to start as low as $349 and feature a 5.8-inch OLED display and Snapdragon 730 processor. Other rumored features include 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>



<p>The star of the Pixel 4a show should be the cameras. Even though the phone should only pack one rear 12MP camera and one 8MP front shooter, Google has done some amazing things with computational photography. That means you should expect good-looking pictures in all lighting conditions, including in low light with Night Sight mode.</p>



<p>We also expect the Pixel 4a to be a battery life champ. The phone&#8217;s leaked capacity is 3,140 mAh, which is more than the 3,000 mAh battery in the Pixel 3a. That phone lasted an epic 11 hours and 59 minutes in our web surfing battery test. So we expect the Pixel 4a to perform just as well if not better and land on our best phone battery life list.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Pixel 4a likely won&#8217;t include 5G connectivity, unlike the OnePlus Nord, and design leaks show that there&#8217;s an old-school fingerprint sensor on the rear of the phone. We&#8217;d prefer a reader built into the display. But these don&#8217;t seem like huge concessions if the price is as low as promised.</p>



<p>The bigger challenge for Google will be not getting drowned out by all of the hype surrounding the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Both phones are set to be announced on August 5 at Samsung Unpacked, which doesn&#8217;t give Google much time to make an impression.</p>



<p>The new Note 20 phones should offer blazing speed via the Snapdragon 865 Plus processor, bigger batteries, and S Pen improvements. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra will gobble up most of the attention, as it&#8217;s expected to feature a new 120Hz LTPO display along with a laser autofocus sensor to complement its three powerful cameras.</p>



<p>Granted, the Pixel 4a is a mid-range phone that&#8217;s targeted at a different type of shopper than the Galaxy Note 20 series. But the Pixel 4a will have to be a super compelling value if it doesn&#8217;t want to be blown away by all the announcements coming out of Samsung Unpacked.</p>

<p>Qualcomm&#8217;s Quick Charge 5 can also power a phone up to 50% in 5 minutes.</p>



<p>Future smartphones are about to charge a lot faster, thanks to an updated version of Qualcomm&#8217;s Quick Charge technology. And the iPhone 12 could look pretty slow by comparison.</p>



<p>Unveiled today (July 27), Quick Charge 5 promises to get your drained Android phone from 0% to 50% battery power after 5 minutes of charging and fully charge in 15 minutes. It&#8217;s the first fast-charging platform capable of supporting more than 100 watts of charging power, Qualcomm says.</p>



<p>By comparison, the iPhone 12 is expected to support a &#8220;fast&#8221; 20W charger, and rumor has it that Apple will not include this charger in the box.</p>



<p>Qualcomm&#8217;s numbers make Quick Charge 5 up to 70% more efficient than Quick Charge 4, the fast-charging technology it replaces. It&#8217;s also 4x faster than its predecessor when using standard USB-C cables.</p>



<p>Qualcomm expects Quick Charge 5 to wind up in devices this quarter, and it&#8217;s currently supported by the chip maker&#8217;s Snapdragon 865 and 865 Plus chipsets. Expect Quick Charge 5 to eventually work its way down to other chipsets in Qualcomm&#8217;s 7 and 6 series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, Qualcomm defers to phone makers on announcing support for its chips and technology, and that&#8217;s holding true with Quick Charge 5. However, Xiaomi said that the new fast charging technology will work its way into future devices from the Chinese phone maker.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://imaginableworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/82XKNCwYdbopHzrKzYVrEa-970-80.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-187" srcset="https://imaginableworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/82XKNCwYdbopHzrKzYVrEa-970-80.jpeg 970w, https://imaginableworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/82XKNCwYdbopHzrKzYVrEa-970-80-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://imaginableworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/82XKNCwYdbopHzrKzYVrEa-970-80-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://imaginableworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/82XKNCwYdbopHzrKzYVrEa-970-80-750x563.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></figure>



<p>For some context on how quickly announced Qualcomm technologies can suddenly appear in phones, Qualcomm took the wraps off the Snapdragon 865 Plus system-on-chip on July 8. Two weeks later, Asus, Lenovo, and Samsung had all announced phones powered by the new chipset.</p>



<p>In addition to faster charge times, Quick Charge 5 enhances dual charging technology by using different paths within the phone to charge batteries, dissipating heat, and improving efficiency. Quick Charge also features Battery Saver and adapter identification technology to smartly determine an adapter&#8217;s capacity; those features work together to extend a battery&#8217;s life cycle. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Enough has been spoken and heard about artificial intelligence and machine learning. Most of us are aware of these technological jargons. We are in a world where we must have come across these technologies on a daily basis, but little do we know deeper about it. From tech to voice to face enabled devices, we all have witnessed a dramatic evolution of technology in the last decade. It did not only contribute towards the transformation of the internet and software industry, but also the lives of individuals – you, me, and us!</p>



<p>Technologies related to AI and ML are expected to grow in the years to come. Even many social media platforms are today investing an ample amount of money in the development of AI techniques to keep their audiences hooked to the platform. Over-viewing the mobile app industry, it is not a hidden fact that today most of the mobile applications are built on AI and ML technologies. Today, we have mobile applications for all our activities – shopping to dating, food to fashion, traveling to surfing, etc.</p>



<p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/607716/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-revenues/"><u>Statista</u></a>, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow greatly by generating 118.6 billion revenue in 2025. Viewing that, the future of AI and ML technology looks very promising. Therefore, it is a great time to incorporate some AL and ML techniques in your mobile application. Let us look at how two of the leading the AI and ML techniques can help build a trending mobile application:</p>



<p><strong>Predict User Behaviour&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>You must have used Amazon or Myntra. Did you get what we are hinting at?</p>



<p>Yes, those suggestions, recommendations, and notifications. They provide you with the most similar products you are looking for. How do you think this happens? Is there is a fairy in the app? Yes, there is and she exactly knows – what you are looking for, what you like and what you don’t, what excites you and what makes you add the items in the cart. Well, no points for guessing, she is AI and ML.</p>



<p>AI and ML mobile applications developed by top AI and ML app developers help the businesses and their marketing teams to understand customer behaviour and psychology. The insights drawn provides information on customer choices, preferences, buying patterns, and budgets by capturing data such as age, location, gender, buying frequency, spending capacity, etc. It is the perfect integration of in-depth data learning and observing the user behaviour across all devices that help create a 360<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;view on customers. The data so collected enables the brands to approach each customer group and deliver products that perfectly fit their individual needs.</p>



<p><strong>Virtual Assistants&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Hey Siri! “Go on, I am listening” – Siri (Well, there’s someone ‘listening’)</p>



<p>That is how we connect with our smartphones these days, don’t we? Siri, Alexa, and Google, all are changing the digital way of communication with our phones and mobile applications. The technology helps you use your phone or a mobile application while you are performing some other task. It has made the user experience much seamless and fruitful.</p>



<p>This technology has further strengthened the trend of online shopping. Today, 95% of online shopping in the world is made through voice commands and that shouldn’t be a surprise. Industry to industry, virtual assistants are greatly impacting and disrupting the way consumers purchase and retailers sell/market.</p>

<h1>Interesting iOS Stats</h1>



<p>With 18% market share and combined share of 99.6% with Android, Apple’s iOS is one of the most happening operating systems of the world. When it comes to using a mobile device, these are the two options users get to choose from. It’s true that Android has a considerable market share. But, we also can’t deny the significance of the iOS platform.</p>



<p>Every time there’s a new iOS device launch, mobile fanatics simply rush to buy it. If you happen to be amongst them, it’s time to breeze through some of lesser known, interesting, and unique facts about the iOS platform. Here we go!</p>



<h3><strong>1. Apple isn’t the pioneer&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Although everyone believes that Apple is the frontrunner in the IOS development arena, that isn’t the truth. Before the emergence of the iPhone, Cisco already patented this name. Cisco’s model was a VOIP one where one could call directly from Skype without using the desktop. After a few initial spats, both the companies came to a settlement and agreed to preserve the respective rights of their devices.</p>



<h3><strong>2. The emergence of App store</strong></h3>



<p>The app store is one of the revolutionary offerings by the IOS platform. Gamers and iPhone owners can download their favorite games from the app store. Most importantly, it helps users download games and apps legally.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Samsung supports IOS (Well, in a different way)&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>We know the fierce rivalry between Apple and Samsung. However, Samsung happens to be the creator of iPhone’s smart chips. In spite of their existing rivalries, Apple doesn’t fail to offer this contract to Samsung. That’s indeed a unique revelation about the iOS platform.</p>



<h3><strong>4. Texting is in&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Apple has transformed texting into a simple and easy way to communicate. Texting someone is much easier and more convenient than calling the person, and it’s all because of Apple and its iOS devices. Sending SMS is no longer a tough ordeal, and you will love doing it!</p>



<h3><strong>5. Incredible sales numbers&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Are you aware of the sales figures recorded by iOS devices in 2011? Well, that will tell you a lot about its market price and value. According to market figures, a whopping 156 million devices have been bought by users. When compared to Mac PC sales, the operating system seems to be the clear winner. If you take a look at the sales figures for the past 28 years, you will come to know that Mac PCs lag way behind!</p>



<h3><strong>6. Revolutionary innovation</strong></h3>
